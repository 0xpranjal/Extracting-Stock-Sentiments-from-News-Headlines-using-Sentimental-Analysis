# Extracting Stock Sentiments from News Headlines using Sentimental Analysis
In this project, I generated investing insights by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Using this natural language processing technique, I was able to understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.

The datasets used in this project are raw HTML files for Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) stocks from FINVIZ.com, a popular website dedicated to stock information and news. Made a plot to visualize the positive, negative, and neutral scores for a single day of trading and single stock.
